Hi, I’m Zhaofan! I’m a last-year Master student in the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City at University of Macau, advised by Prof. Pengyang Wang. I’m also a 24Fall PhD student at HKUST-GZ@AI Thrust, supervised by Prof. Hui Xiong and Prof. Sihong Xie. 

My research interests include Data Mining, AI for social good, Spatial-Temporal analysis, explainable AI, and Graph RL. I received my bachelor’s degree in Statistics from School of Mathematics, Southwest Jiaotong University in 2021.
