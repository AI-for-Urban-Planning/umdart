Dr. Pengyang Wang is currently an assistant professor at the University of Macau. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida in 2021, the M.S. degree in Information Security from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017, and the B.S. degree in Information Security from Xidian University in 2014. His research interests include data mining and machine learning. He has research experience in industry research labs, such as Yahoo! Research, NEC Labs, and Huawei Big Data Lab. He has published in refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as IEEE TKDE, ACM TIST, ACM SIGKDD, AAAI, IJCAI and WWW.

Dr. Pengyang Wang has broad interests in data mining and machine learning, especially in geospatial-temporal data modeling. Geospatial-temporal data is the indicator of Internet-of-Things (IoT), which reveals complex patterns underneath the human-environment system. The research objective is to understand the heterogeneity and dynamics of the system, and further provide optimal decision support for boosting commercial activities, enhancing public security, fostering social interaction, and thus yielding livable, sustainable, and viable environments. His research is motivated by real-world applications, such as business, transportation, energy, critical infrastructure defense, etc.
